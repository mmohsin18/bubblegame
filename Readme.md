Bubble game is a fun project of mine that I did while learning basic coding. This project is learnt from Sheriyans Coding School. This is a part of my 'Learning new Things' series.

The name of the game is Bubble Game. It is a browser based game that yu can play online from your own browser. This may not run smooth on mobile devices but will run just fine in desktop and tab.

<b> Instructions:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Click the Play Game button from below</li>
<li>Click Start from the top Bar and the timer will start. You will have 30 seconds</li>
<li>In the new page there will be three boxes, Hit, Timer, Score. The hit box will generate a random number everytime. You have to click on the generated number from the bubbles below.</li>
<li>When the time is finished your score will be shown</li>
</ul>
